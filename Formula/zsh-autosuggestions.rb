    <<~EOS
      To activate the autosuggestions, add the following at the end of your .zshrc:

        source #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh

      You will also need to force reload of your .zshrc:

        source ~/.zshrc
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "history",
      shell_output("zsh -c '. #{pkgshare}/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh && echo $ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_STRATEGY'")
  end
end
